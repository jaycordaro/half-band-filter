# half-band-filter
An implementation of a half-band filter, from MATLAB to fixed point in SystemVerilog.  It annoyed me there was not much fixed point FIR filter code, showing how to take a Matlab model and generate RTL.

## Half-Band Filters

### Matlab Implementation

### fi, and the problem with fi

In RTL, fixed point filters are implemented in various formats, Q Format is the most common, although I have seen others in industry.  The Matlab `fi` functions are useful to check for overflow and optimize bit-widths, but the actual filter implementation is typically in Q format.  

### Q Format
For this code, Q.15 is used and consists of a sign bit plus 15 fractional bits = 16 bits.  For more information on Q Format, see the Wikipedia page.  

### Q Conversion

For our purposes, Q conversions are as follows:
#### Float to Q
To convert a number from floating point to Qm.n format:

Multiply the floating point number by (2^n -1)
Round to the nearest integer

#### Q to float
To convert a number from Qm.n format to floating point:

Convert the number to floating point as if it were an integer, remove the binary point
Multiply by (2^âˆ’n -1)
