# SystemVerilog RTL

A SystemVerilog implementation of the Matlab-designed filter.  Rather than relying on Matlab `fi` function(s), the Matlab is implemented in Q15.  The SystemVerilog module implementes `hb_check.m` in fixed-point Q15.

## Usage

`hb_filter.sv` is fully synthesizable
`hb_filter_tb.sv` was checked in ModelSim 2021.4.  The `inputs.txt` and `outputs.txt` generated by the Matlab function `hb_check_tb.m` are required to run the SV testbench.
